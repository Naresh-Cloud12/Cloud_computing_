So we are getting 404 not found because we did not have data in index.html file so we need to upload the file so we will get output.
Now come to the root user we can able to give other user some permisson using IAM and also we can make some group if they are using same services.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d3f3b6f-8091-4848-b385-86c3a8d28e60)
